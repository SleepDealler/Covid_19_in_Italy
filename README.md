Project about Covid-19 in Italy by Krzysztof Lukasz and Daniel Zalewski


1. Project Objective
The objective of the project was to present cases of illness, mortality, and healthcare in Italy during Covid-19. Python was used to create the charts, utilizing packages such as matplotlib, plotly, and bar-chart-race.

2. Data
The data used to create the charts were obtained from:
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sources-comparison
https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19
https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati
https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/wykaz-zarazen-koronawirusem-sars-cov-2

3. Additional information
The raw ovid-covid-data contained data for the entire world, so the data was filtered for Poland and Italy, from which the owid-covid-data_filtered.csv file was created and used in the project instead of the raw data (due to excessive memory usage).
