        <strong>III. Healthcare</strong><br>
        - The Italian healthcare system faced enormous challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals, especially in the northern part of the country, were overwhelmed, and medical resources, such as ventilators and intensive care beds, were severely limited.<br>
        - To alleviate the burden on the healthcare system, Italy implemented a series of countermeasures, including the construction of temporary field hospitals, recruitment of additional medical staff, and increased production and import of medical equipment.<br>
        - The COVID-19 vaccination campaign began at the end of 2020. By June 2024, the majority of the population had been vaccinated, significantly reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths.<br>
